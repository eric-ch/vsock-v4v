A collection of tests for the vsock module from userland (and aimed at
stressing the v4v_transport implementation).

Test binaries may share headers in common/include to avoid code duplication and
ease test writing.

sockops will ease testing usual socket behaviour through cli. It provides a
trivial logic to add commands in order to test standard socket operations.

Usage: sockops <command> [...]
Commands:
help    Display help.

socket      <stream|dgram>      Create a V4V socket of given type.
sendto      <addr> <port> <msg> Send a datagram message to the given address:port pair.
recvfrom    <port>              Read and block until a datagram message is received on the given port. The receive message is printed back on stdout.

spam should make stressing the implementation easier by sending datagrams in
threads to n-n endpoints.

Usage: spam <command> [...]
Commands:
help    Display help.
recvfrom        <n> <port>              From <port> to <port> + n-1, wait for datagram to be received, then print the payload on stdout.
sendto  <id> <n> <port> From <port> to <port> + n-1, >
